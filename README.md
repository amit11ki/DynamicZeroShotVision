# Zero-Shot Object Detection with OWL-ViT

This project demonstrates real-time **zero-shot object detection** using the [OWL-ViT](https://huggingface.co/google/owlvit-base-patch32) model from Hugging Face Transformers. The system can detect **objects described by arbitrary text prompts** without retraining.

---

## 🧠 Overview

**DynamicZeroShotVision** is designed to:

- Accept input from a webcam or a local video file.
- Use custom object categories (e.g., lightbulb, matchstick, monitor, lion, gaming console) that are not part of the COCO dataset.
- Process each video frame using a zero-shot model to detect objects.
- Display annotated video with bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores.
- Allow live updating of detection classes during runtime.
- Log predictions for further analysis.

## 🖥️ Example Classes

The system is initialized with some example classes:

```text
lightbulb, matchstick, monitor, lion, gaming console
```

You can change these live by pressing `c` during detection.

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amit11ki/DynamicZeroShotVision.git
cd DynamicZeroShotVision
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install torch opencv-python transformers numpy pillow
```

## ▶️ Usage

### Command Line Arguments
```bash
python main.py --source 0                      # Use webcam (default)
python main.py --source path/to/video.mp4      # Use video file
python main.py --no-jit                        # Disable TorchScript acceleration
```

## ⌨️ Keyboard Controls
While the application is running:

- `q`: Quit the program
- `c`: Change detection classes dynamically

## 📝 Logs

Detection results are saved to:
```
detections_log.json
```

Each entry includes the frame number, timestamp, and detected objects.
